# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
The gameboard:

The board is 3x3 squares and below are the locations to place your piece.

1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9

How to play: 

1. You are X, the computer is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

2. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.

3. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.


/**
On a personal note, I created this project to practice using 2d arrays, if statements, and methods. I learned a lot by putting them all together for the first time and had a lot of fun doing it. If you find yourself reading this, you could have played any of the millions of Tic-Tac-Toe games in the world but you are playing mine. I appreciate it!
